        <h1>AboutMe</h1> <hr>
        <p>From a young age building something unique with my own hands was a passion, programming and WebDevelopment as opened the door for me to make this passion my career.
        Programming allows me to put myself into challenging problem solving situations following both programming and mathmatical patterns to make high quality professional websites.
        What started with a simple HTML Document my friend showed me how to make, has turned into a workdrive and desire to build and create original projects and programs.
        Though I am still new to the world of programming, I am searching for a company that will allow me to expand my knowledge of programming, while being productive by proving my worth through my code.

        <h2 class='aldun'>Aldun Website <p><b><a href='https://aldun.netlify.app/'>Aldun Website</a></b></p></h2>
        <p>Aldun is a locally created table top roleplaying game system. Made by a few people I know that decided they wanted to make a website set up for their system. I made it for them using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSReact.
        </p>
        <h2 class='pryzmhomesystem'>Pryzm Home System <p>(Due to the company's closing I don't have access to the website/application)</p></h2>
        <p>PryzmHomeSystem is a discontinued buisness in which allowed people to have a tool to take care for their homes. Pryzm was created locally and was my first step into the programming world.
        I was the manager of the company whilst it was running, and was set to be the beta tester (Due to prior experience in the field.) for the website, app, and any new functions in the program.
        This program was made in ruby, I haven't done work in ruby personally but got to work with a senior software developer in the creation of the website for 3-4 years.
        </p>
        <h2 class='betatesting'>Beta Testing<br> </h2>
        <p>From the young age of 12 I entered into the world of program and game beta testing for numerous companies. I learned how to break coding, and work outside the box to try to find bugs within a program.
        Some games/programs I beta tested for. Include: Pryzm(App and Website), Hawken(game), Terraria(game), MinecraftMods(10-11 Different Mods), Tree of Life (game), Planetside2(game), Staxel(game), and many more.
        Being involved in deconstructing coding through the application led me to an early on desire to understand programming, which later on fed my passion for programming.
